SINGLY LINKED LIST
is a fundamental data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node stores a data element and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the list. Singly linked lists are used to implement dynamic data structures that can grow or shrink easily, making them useful for various applications.
